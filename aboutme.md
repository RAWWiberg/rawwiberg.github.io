title: About me
---

I am evolutionary biologist with an interest in sexual selection and conflict. I apply the methods of modern genomics to try to understand how sexual selection and sexual conflict drive evolutionary change. 

2014-2017 I conducted my PhD studies at the University of St Andrews under the supervision of Prof. [Mike Ritchie](). My main focus was on population genomic analyses of experimental evolution lines of *Drosophila pseudoobscura* under altered mating systems, and natural populations of *Drosophila montana*, an extremely cold-tolerant fly.

I am currently a post-doc in the group of Dr. [Lukas Sch√§rer](http://evolution.unibas.ch/scharer/) at the University of Basel, where my work involves comparative genomics in a group of hermaphroditic flatworms.
