title: About me
---

I am evolutionary biologist with an interest in sexual selection and conflict. I apply the methods of modern genomics to try to understand how sexual selection and sexual conflict drive evolutionary change. I am currently a post-doc at the [University of Basel](http://evolution.unibas.ch/scharer/) where my work involves comparative genomics in a group of hermaphroditic flatworms.
