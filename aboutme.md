title: About me
---

I am evolutionary biologist with an interest in sexual selection and conflict. I apply the methods of modern genomics to try to understand how sexual selection and sexual conflict drive evolutionary change. 

Since the start of 2022, I am a postdoc in the group of Dr. [Elina Immonen](https://immonenelina.wordpress.com/) at Uppsala University in Sweden. My work here will investigate gene expression changes in response to different forms of selection for increased sexual dimorphism in the seed beetle *Callosobruchus maculatus*. 

From 2017 until the end of 2021 I worked as a post-doc in the group of Dr. [Lukas Sch√§rer](http://evolution.unibas.ch/scharer/) at the University of Basel, in Switzerland, where my work involved comparative genomics in a genus of hermaphroditic flatworms called *Macrostomum*.

Between 2014 and 2017 I conducted my PhD studies at the University of St Andrews under the supervision of Prof. [Mike Ritchie](). My main focus was on population genomic analyses of experimental evolution lines of *Drosophila pseudoobscura* under altered mating systems, and natural populations of *Drosophila montana*, an extremely cold-tolerant fly.
