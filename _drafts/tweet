I and co-authors had another paper published recently in @molecology. This one on how population genetic differentiation is associated with ecological variables in the cold(❄️) tolerant D. montana. 
1/4

We quantified ecological variation across 24 populations of D. montana and chose six for whole-genome 🧬 sequencing and further phenotyping. 
2/4

Main findings:
-❄tolerance varied by latitude.
-Many 🧬 markers were associated with phenotypes + ecology.
-🧬 markers overrepresented on chrom. 4 (known for many polymorphic inversions).
-Associated genes have previously been implicated in species divergence and ❄️tolerance.
